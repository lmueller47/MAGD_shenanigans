# MAGD_shenanigans

this is the repository for Logan Mueller's MAGD projects.

This is a project where I made a rudimentary version of [Pong](https://github.com/lmueller47/MAGD_shenanigans/tree/gh-pages/Pong). 

This was my first project for the class working with [black and white design](https://github.com/lmueller47/MAGD_shenanigans/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab01_Mueller).

This is a data represetnation of the [population size](https://github.com/lmueller47/MAGD_shenanigans/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab10_Mueller) of three cities in the US in 2014 utilizing 3D shapes with different textures.

This is a [movie poster](https://github.com/lmueller47/MAGD_shenanigans/tree/gh-pages/Movie_Poster) with two images with filters and moving text.

This was a project working with color design ment to resemble the underbelly of an [alien spaceship](https://github.com/lmueller47/MAGD_shenanigans/tree/gh-pages/spaceship), but in a 2D style.
